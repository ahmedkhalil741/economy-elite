// Assigns a ride to a driver and gets it onto his phone.
//
// Three things happen, and none of them is allowed to stop the others:
//   1. The Bookings sheet row gets his name in the `driver` column.
//   2. The calendar entry is retitled so the ride reads "— Hany" at a glance,
//      and his name and number go into the description.
//   3. He gets an email with the ride sheet and a .ics file attached. Tapping
//      the attachment puts the ride on his own phone's calendar, with a
//      reminder, whether he uses Google, Apple or anything else.
//
// WHY A .ICS FILE RATHER THAN A CALENDAR INVITATION: Google does not let a
// service account invite guests to an event unless the whole domain is set up
// to let it act as a person (domain-wide delegation). An attached .ics needs
// no permission from anybody, works for a driver who has never touched Google
// Calendar, and can't be broken by a Workspace setting changing underneath us.
//
// The response carries a ready-written text message and an sms: link. The
// dispatch page turns that into a "Text the driver" button, so the message is
// sent from the owner's own phone, from his own number — no texting service to
// pay for, and the driver can just reply.
