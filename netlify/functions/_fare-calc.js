// Internal fare estimator — NOT shown to customers as a public price list.
// It works out what a trip costs so the owner email, the calendar event and
// the Bookings sheet all agree, and so a price can be quoted instantly.
//
// ---- HOW PRICING WORKS ----
// Flat rates, never per-mile. The customer is told one number before the car
// moves. The site promises "No surge pricing. No meter. No surprises", and
// a meter would break that promise.
//
// A trip is priced from a TOWN and a DESTINATION:
//
//   town  -> the pickup or drop-off that isn't an airport or Manhattan
//   dest  -> Newark (EWR), Manhattan, LaGuardia or JFK
//
// TOWN_FARES below holds one price per town per destination. Those are SEDAN
// prices, all in. An SUV adds a surcharge on top: $35 to Newark, $50 to
// Manhattan, LaGuardia or JFK. A sedan adds nothing.
//
// Trips between two listed towns are the local flat rate, same either car.
// Anything else returns matched:false and is quoted by hand.
//
// ---- WHY THERE IS NO LONGER A "NEW YORK SEDAN FEE" ----
// There used to be a $35 surcharge on New York trips in a sedan, on top of
// the base. The town table replaced it, because these prices are already
// complete sedan prices — adding a sedan fee would charge it twice and put
// the sedan fares well above the local market. SEDAN_FEE_NY stays exported
// as null so the sheet's sedan_fee_ny column keeps writing "N/A".
//
// To change a price, edit TOWN_FARES. To add a town, copy a row. Nothing
// else needs to change.

const { cardFeeFor } = require('./_card-fee');

// A number, or null. Zero is a real answer — "waive the card fee" is written
// as 0 and has to survive, so a plain falsy check would throw it away.
function numOrNull(v) {
  return ((v === 0 || v) && !isNaN(parseFloat(v))) ? Math.max(0, parseFloat(v)) : null;
}

// SUV surcharges. A sedan pays neither.
const SUV_FEE = 35;        // to Newark
const SUV_FEE_NY = 50;     // to Manhattan, LaGuardia, JFK

// WHICH CARS PRICE AS A SEDAN.
//
// The Suburban is the only one that costs more, so this is the whole of the
// question "does the surcharge apply". The Tesla seats four and takes the
// same roads; charging Suburban money for it would be charging for a car
// nobody is getting.
//
// Named rather than written as "anything that isn't an SUV", because the
// vehicle arrives as free text from a form and from the sheet, and a typo
// would then quietly bill somebody the Suburban rate. Unknown pays the
// higher price: being asked for $35 you do not owe is a phone call, giving
// away $35 is gone.

// ---- TOLLS ----
// Charged to the customer as their own line, never buried in the base fare.
// The site promises "No surge pricing. No meter. No surprises", and a toll
// added after the ride is exactly the surprise that promise rules out.
//
// THESE ARE AHMED'S FIXED FIGURES, not a live lookup, and they are ROUND TRIP.
// The passenger travels one way; the car does not. Sending a driver to JFK
// means paying to get there and paying to get back, and the customer who
// caused the journey pays for the journey. This is how black-car and limousine
// operators normally quote out-of-area work, and it is why these are roughly
// double a one-way published rate.
//
// It follows that the toll applies whether the trip GOES to New York or COMES
// FROM it - either way the car makes the round trip. The code already matches
// a destination at either end, so that falls out for free.
//
// Flat amounts, deliberately. Real tolls move with the hour and the crossing,
// but a number that changes while a customer is on the phone is worse than a
// number that is occasionally a dollar out.

// short job than turn someone away over a two-hour floor.
const HOURLY_RATE = 60;

// ---- A STOP ON THE WAY ----
//
// Ahmed's rule, 30 October: "$15 for any short stops, but for a long ride
// just add a normal price as a full ride." So a quick stop - collect somebody,
// drop a bag, pick up a key - is a flat $15 and the route price is otherwise
// untouched. A detour that is really another journey (his example: Summit, a
// stop in Morristown, then on) is not a stop at all; it is priced as its own
// leg at the listed fare, which is a judgement nobody can make from an address
// string, so Ahmed makes it when he confirms the booking.
//
// It goes on the DRIVING charge rather than beside it, which is deliberate
// and is the other half of his instruction - "the tip will be for the whole
// amount". The tip is 20% of driving, so adding the stop fee there means the
// tip counts it, and the card fee counts it too. A stop that paid no tip
// would quietly make the driver's hour worth less for the trouble.
//
// Hourly trips get no stop fee: the hours already cover the stops, which is
// what Ahmed meant by "stops inside the waiting time, that's fine".
// Revised 30 October, Ahmed's rule: "if it's a stop in the same town, a quick
// stop, no additional fee. If it's in another town, make $10 additional fee."
//
// Which is the right shape. Pulling in on the way past somebody's house three
// streets from the pickup costs the driver two minutes; crossing into the next
// town costs him a leg of a journey. A flat fee for both was charging for the
// first and undercharging for the second.
const STOP_FEE = 10;

// What the stops add, and whether we can price them at all.
//
// A stop in a town that is not on the rate card is the same situation as a
// FARE that is not on the rate card, and gets the same answer: we do not
// invent a number, we say it needs quoting by hand. Ahmed's instruction -
// "if not listed just make same as we do if the fare not listed". A long
// detour is really another journey and he prices it himself, by the hour or
// as its own leg; no address string tells you which.

//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT (found by audit, 2026-09-18): the old code
// scanned the WHOLE address string for a town name. In New Jersey, street
// names ARE town names, so:
//
//   "123 Madison Ave, Lakewood, NJ"  ->  priced as Madison, $105
//                                        Lakewood is 55 miles away
//   "45 Summit Ave, Hackensack, NJ"  ->  priced as Summit, $75
//   "9 Westfield Ave, Elizabeth, NJ" ->  priced as Westfield, $85
//   "10 Manhattan Ave, Union, NJ"    ->  priced as a MANHATTAN run, $135,
//                                        for a six-mile local hop
//   "Cranford, Union County, NJ"     ->  priced as Union, off the COUNTY name
//
// Every one of those is a wrong price on a real booking, in both directions,
// with nothing in the sheet looking odd afterwards.
//
// The fix: only ever look at the parts of an address that name a PLACE.
// Google formats addresses as comma-separated parts —
// "24 Gales Dr, New Providence, NJ 07974, USA" — so the street is the first
// part, and it goes in the bin along with the state, the ZIP, the country and
// anything ending in "County".

// ---- DISCOUNTS ----
//
// A discount comes off the DRIVING charge and off nothing else. Two rules
// decide that, and both are about money actually moving:
//
//   The toll is never discounted. The bridge charges what the bridge charges,
//   and knocking money off it means Ahmed pays the difference to the Port
//   Authority out of his own pocket rather than giving the customer a gift.
//
//   The card fee is worked out AFTER the discount, never before. Square takes
//   its percentage of what is actually swiped, so a $20 discount has to shrink
//   the fee too. Discounting after the fee would have him handing a processor
//   a cut of money he never collected.
//
// The discount can never be larger than the driving charge — a $50 credit on a
// $35 local run takes the fare to zero and stops there. The leftover stays on
// the customer's balance for next time rather than turning into cash.
//
// Two versions of the breakdown come back. `display` says the discount out
// loud, and that one is for Ahmed. `driverDisplay` folds it silently into the
// fare, and that is the one the driver and the calendar see, because a driver
// reading "$15 discount" next to a number he has to collect is a question he
// should never have to ask.
