// WHY THE CREDITS TAB IS GONE — Ahmed's call, 2026-10-25.
//
// It was a separate tab with one row per credit event, and for three weeks it
// sat completely empty, because the first event a customer ever generates is
// the $15 at ten rides. He asked about it three times. A tab that will look
// broken until somebody's tenth ride is a tab that costs more in doubt than
// it returns in tidiness, and he does not want to open a second sheet to find
// out why a balance is what it is.
//
// So the reason now lives on the CUSTOMER, in credit_history, next to the
// balance it explains - and the morning email already prints that cell beside
// the amount owed, which is where he actually reads it.
//
// The objection to this before was that the cell grew without limit. It did,
// because the old version wrote a line for every single ride. Credits are
// rare - ten rides apart, a birthday, a referral - so at this size the cell
// holds a couple of entries a year, and KEEP_ENTRIES caps it regardless.
