// instead of 2.6% + 15c. Until now everybody was quoted the tapped price and
// Ahmed absorbed the difference - about $2.20 on a $245 ride. His call,
// 23 October: the customer pays the real cost of the method they chose.
//
// IT HAS TO BE KNOWN AT BOOKING TIME, which is the whole reason this reads
// the sheet rather than waiting for the car. Every message we send promises
// a flat price with nothing added at the end, and a fee that changes once the
// reader comes out would make that a lie for two dollars.
//
// So a NEW customer is always quoted the tapped rate: they carry no flag yet,
// and this returns false. The flag is set the first time Ahmed marks a ride
// "On file" on the dispatch - a button he already presses - and from the next
// booking on, the price is right from the start.
